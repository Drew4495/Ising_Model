This source code is a Python implementation of our resting-state Structural Connectome model, which infers the signed (excitatory + / inhibitory –) connection strengths between brain regions by solving an inverse Ising problem regularized by diffusion-MRI tractography. The pipeline ingests subject-level resting-state fMRI time-series and a structural connectivity matrix, binarizes the BOLD signals, and then uses maximum pseudolikelihood estimation—with a tunable structural penalty and noise term—to learn the pair-wise interaction matrix (the rsSC). For each hyper-parameter pair the code (i) fits the model, (ii) simulates forward Ising dynamics to generate synthetic BOLD, and (iii) scores the solution by the mean of its structural- and functional-connectivity correlations with empirical data; the hyper-parameter set with the highest score yields the optimized rsSC. The resulting matrix allows region- or network-level calculation of an excitation-inhibition ratio (EIR), enabling mechanistic interpretation of large-scale brain dynamics while respecting anatomical constraints. Scripts are provided for end-to-end execution—from data preprocessing and hyper-parameter sweeps to visualization of the signed connectome and EIR metrics—along. FOr a real-world application, please see results reported in Burns et al., 2025 (see docs directory for details).
